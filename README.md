CertifyHub is a decentralized platform that connects funders with projects by utilizing blockchain technology. The platform allows project owners to register hypercerts, which showcase project details, and utilizes various technologies to facilitate transparent funding and collaboration.

## Overview

CertifyHub enables the seamless connection between funders and projects through the following features:

## Problem

Traditional funding platforms often lack transparency, decentralized control, and efficient payment methods. CertifyHub addresses these issues by utilizing blockchain technology and decentralized protocols.

## Description

CertifyHub is a groundbreaking platform that revolutionizes the way funders connect with projects by harnessing the power of blockchain technology. With a focus on transparency, CertifyHub leverages cutting-edge tools such as Hypercerts to showcase project details with authenticity. Through decentralized splitter contracts, received funds are intelligently distributed among project stakeholders based on predefined hypercert rules, supporting both streamlined fund streaming and traditional funding splits. The platform's integration with the Drips Protocol enables flexible payment options, while the ability to provide feedback and updates fosters a collaborative environment for project enhancement. Users can also create comprehensive profiles, enhancing funders' understanding of projects through insightful feedback. By utilizing technologies like IPFS, Filecoin, and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), CertifyHub ensures secure, decentralized, and user-friendly interactions for a new era of transparent and efficient project funding and collaboration.

## Technologies Used

- Hypercerts: Showcasing project details and ensuring transparency.
- IPFS and Filecoin (NFT.Storage and CO2.Transform): Storing and retrieving project-related content in a decentralized manner.
- Drips Protocol: Supporting stream payments and traditional funding splits.
- Tableland: Storing contract interactions with decentralized access control.
- Ethereum Name Service (ENS): Providing user-friendly Ethereum addresses.
